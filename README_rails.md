# Ruby on Rails Patient Management System

## Introduction
This Rails application provides two portalsâ€”one for receptionists and one for doctors. Receptionists can register and manage patients, while doctors can view patient data and a graph representing patient registrations over time. It also includes proper authentication and user roles.
